Voice CAPTCHA node.js client
<<<<<<< HEAD

This is a node.js client for the voice CAPTCHA service.
See the "test.js" file for the sample integrations.

The integration requires an API key. You can use a default key = "8ZorddayPS2A5iKK9o3q3M6xr2YffGM8e9RPDmr7" for testing.
For production usage, we ask that you obtain a dedicated key. We are building the developer console where you can get
the key automatically. In the meantime, you can submit a request for a key by going to https://avs.cloud/captcha.

The API offers multiple CAPTCHA configurations and will add additional ones in the future.

Type   | Length |     Characteritic             | API cc parameter value
Number |    2   |   Different Voices            |      1
Number |    2   |   Different Voices / Noises   |      2

Number |    3   |   Different Voices		|      3
